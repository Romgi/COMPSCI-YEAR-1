                My prior web experience: Basic HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP experience from high school courses. I helped
                develop a web app for scouting FRC robots. So far, I am excited for this course and what it has to
                offer. The web dev team element also seems like a lot of fun.

                One thing I learned today is how to use <strong>relative links</strong>
                to connect pages in a website. And how to host my projects on the course web server.

                Today we formed our web dev groups for the rest of the semester. Our group set up a shared github to
                make collaboration much easier but we still need to think of a proper name and product. I'm working on a
                way to automatically upload the most recent version of the code to the 1xd3 server as soon as its
                committed to the github repository.

                Today I worked on enhancing my personal portfolio website. I updated the footer with interactive buttons
                which are both functional and visually appealing. I also improved the overall styling of the site to
                make it more cohesive and user-friendly. I am currently working on making the site responsive so it
                looks good on all devices.

            <p>
                Today I continued workingon my portfolio website. The site is now fully responsive and looks good on all
                devices. In my web dev group, we updated our group website, adding a style sheet and nav bar. We also
                added a page showcasing examples of good and bad web development. The group site is also responsive now
                as well and should adjust to different screen sizes and orientatins.

                Today I learned about JavaScript and how to use it to add interactivity to web pages. I started the
                exercises on JavaScript and will host them on the course web server when they are completed. I learned
                that JavaScript is an imperative programming language that is dynamically and weakly typed. I also
                added a github commit graph to my portfolio homepage using a third-party library.

                Today my web dev group presented our client report from the McMaster Concert Band. We aim to develop a
                website and web app which can function as a hub for information, recordings, and music storage to
                provide both utility for Concert Band members and information for the general public. We also did more
                JavaScript and completed activities in pairs to get more familiar with the Document Object Model (DOM).

                Today I worked on more JavaScript exercises, focusing on event handling and manipulating the DOM. I
                learned how to add event listeners to HTML elements and how to change the content and style of elements
                dynamically based on user interactions. I think my prior programming knowledge has helped me understand
                JavaScript to an extent, but it is also quite different from my past experience. The most surprising
                think I learned about the JavaScript language is how flexible it is with types and how it interacts with
                HTML and CSS. The most challenging part of programming in JavaScript so far has been understanding how
                to access specific elements in the DOM and how to manipulate them effectively.
