                My prior web experience: Basic HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP experience from high school courses. I helped
                develop a web app for scouting FRC robots. So far, I am excited for this course and what it has to
                offer. The web dev team element also seems like a lot of fun.

                One thing I learned today is how to use <strong>relative links</strong>
                to connect pages in a website. And how to host my projects on the course web server.

                Today we formed our web dev groups for the rest of the semester. Our group set up a shared github to
                make collaboration much easier but we still need to think of a proper name and product. I'm working on a
                way to automatically upload the most recent version of the code to the 1xd3 server as soon as its
                committed to the github repository.

                Today I worked on enhancing my personal portfolio website. I updated the footer with interactive buttons
                which are both functional and visually appealing. I also improved the overall styling of the site to
                make it more cohesive and user-friendly. I am currently working on making the site responsive so it
                looks good on all devices.
