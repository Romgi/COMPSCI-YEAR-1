          <h2>Canada’s Conservative leader echoes Reagan as his party regroups</h2>
          <p class="body desktop-only">CALGARY, Alberta — Canada’s Conservative leader channeled a legendary American
            president as he secured his hold on the party grassroots — and and debuted his new message to voters for a
            federal election that could come as early as spring.

            Pierre Poilievre is rebuilding after last year’s election defeat, losing to Mark Carney, a rookie Liberal
            politician who leapfrogged and stunned the once-favored Conservatives.

            Before the Liberal comeback, the Conservatives seemed set to ride a wave of anti-incumbent sentiment
            sweeping much of the Western world.</p>
          <p class="body tablet-mobile-only">A year out from a bruising loss to Mark Carney, the opposition leader is
            betting the next election on a simple test: are voters better off?</p>

          <h2>This Tire Brand Scores The Worst For Owner Satisfaction In Consumer Reports' Ranking</h2>
          <p class="body desktop-only">As the only part of the car that's actually supposed to make contact with the
            road, tires are crucial for keeping your car safe and performing well. But, like anything else in the world
            of cars, they're not all built equal. That fact is evident when seeing how certain manufacturers failed to
            perform to standard in a recent Consumer Reports (CR) study on tire brand satisfaction.

            The study considered all-season, all-terrain, winter/snow, and summer tires. Of the brands surveyed,
            Sumitomo ended up with the lowest overall satisfaction levels, finishing at the bottom of the table in two
            of the four tire categories (all-terrain and summer). It also languished as second-to-last in the all-season
            and winter/snow categories.

            Sumitomo tires performed more poorly than others in key priority areas for consumers, such as handling
            capabilities, grip on wet roads, and longevity. Their tires were found to wear more quickly on
            average, compromising a car's ability to grip the road effectively. All four Sumitomo tires rated by CR –
            namely the HTR A/S P03 (all-season tire), HTR Z5 (summer tire), Ice Edge (winter), and Encounter HT2
            (all-season SUV tires) — scored poorly across the board, receiving some of the lowest ratings possible for
            owner satisfaction.</p>

            recent owner satisfaction survey</p>

          <h3>A practice known as ‘house burping’ is gaining traction online. What is it?</h3>

            While it may seem like an unremarkable practice, “lüften,” or “house burping” – as it’s referred to in the
