          <p class="body desktop-only">After months of debate, the city will run a three-month pilot extending bus

          <p class="body desktop-only">A university team announced a lab prototype that charges more quickly while
            keeping temperatures low. The researchers say the design could reduce charging time for small devices and
            e-bikes. Independent testing will be needed before any commercial release. The team plans to publish full
            results later this semester.</p>
